# Contributing to UM-BMID

## How can I contribute?

The value in UM-BMID is in the data itself. This repository contains 
supplementary scripts designed to demonstrate use of the dataset.

If you wish to contribute, the best way to do so is to make your own data 
open-access. Open-access datasets allow researchers to evaluate their 
methods on other systems, larger and more diverse datasets, and helps to 
accelerate the development of breast microwave imaging systems toward 
clinical use.

### Contributing to the Dataset

The dataset itself has documentation, available 
[here](https://bit.ly/UM-bmid), and contains metadata for each phantom scan. 
If you have suggestions, concerns, or comments regarding the dataset 
documentation, storage, or metadata, please contact the authors directly at
**UManitoba.BMS@gmail.com**.

If you would like to make your own dataset open-access and would like to 
discuss jointly hosting and curating the data, please contact the authors 
directly at **UManitoba.BMS@gmail.com**.

### Contributing to the Code Repository

While the value in UM-BMID is in the data itself, this repository supplements
the dataset. If you notice any bugs, please create a bug report as a 
[GitHub issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). 

If you would like to suggest an enhancement, please create an 
enhancement suggestion as a

### Questions, Concerns, Collaboration
