# UM-BMID

The University of Manitoba Breast Microwave Imaging Dataset (UM-BMID) is
an open-access dataset available to all researchers. The dataset contains
data from experimental scans of MRI-derived breast phantoms 

**The dataset itself can be found [here](https://bit.ly/UM-bmid).** 
The shortened link is https://bit.ly/UM-bmid (sensitive to capitals). 

The dataset is described in a submitted manuscript:

T. Reimer, J. Krenkevich, and S. Pistorius, "An open-access experimental
dataset for breast microwave imaging,", _2020 European Conference on
Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2020)_, submitted.

This GitHub repository contains the code used to produce the results
presented in that paper and supportive scripts for the UM-BMID dataset.
