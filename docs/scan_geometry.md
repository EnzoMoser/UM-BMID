## Scan Geoemtry

The antennas, cables, and VNA are all held on a rotating module. During 
a scan, the module rotates (**clockwise** rotation) to 72 polar angles,
evenly spaced between 0&deg; and 355&deg;. At each rotational position,
the S-parameters are measured.

The coordinate system used to define positions within the imaging 
chamber is defined as follows (and displayed in the pdf file available
at https://bit.ly/UM-bmid). 

- The long-axis of the bed system is defined as the y-axis. The positive
 direction is defined to be in the direction of the patients head during
 a patient scan.
- The x-axis is in-plane with the bed system surface, and the positive 
 direction is defined to be the direction of the patients **right side**
 as they lay prone on the bed.
- The origin of the x-y plane is defined to be at the center of the 
 imaging chamber.
- The z-axis is perpendicular to the x-y plane. The negative z-direction
 extends downward toward the ground with respect to the bed system surface.
 (I.e., when prone, the breast extends toward the negative z-direction). 

The first port antenna begins each scan at a polar angle of -130&deg; with 
respect to this coordinate system during all gen-two scans. During 
gen-one scans, the first port antenna began at a polar angle of -102.5&deg;.
The second port antenna (for gen-two scans only) begans at a polar angle
of -70&deg;, and is located with a +60&deg; offset with respect to the
first antenna.
