## Equipment Information

This file contains information regarding the equipment used to perform
the scans that comprise UM-BMID.

### Vector Network Analyzer (VNA)

The vector network analyzer used in the system is the Planar 804/1
VNA produced by Copper Mountain Technologies, Indianapolis, IN, USA.
The settings used during scans are as follows:

- 1-8 GHz bandwidth
- 1001 linearly-spaced frequency measurements over the bandwidth
- 10 kHz IF bandwidth
- 10 dBm output power

In monostatic scans (gen-one), the S<sub>11</sub> scattering parameter
was measured. In bistatic scans (gen-two), the S<sub>11</sub> and
S<sub>21</sub> scattering parameters were measured. 

### Antennas

The antennas used in the system are double-ridged horn antennas, 
model LB-20200-SF produced by A-INFO, Chengdu, China.
