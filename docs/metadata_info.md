## Metadata Information

This table provides descriptions for each piece of metadata recorded 
in each scan.

| Metadata String | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| expt_num | The expeirment number within that experimental session.
| | |
| id | The unique ID number of the experiment, with respect to the entire dataset. |
| | |
| phant_id | The ID tag of the phantom (ex: A3F4 indicates the scan was of the adipose shell A3 with fibroglandular shell F4).
| | |
| tum_rad | The radius of the tumor used in the scan, in centimeters. |
| | |
| tum_shape | The shape of the tumor in the scan. |
| tum_x | The x-position of the tumor, in centimeters, relative to the center of the imaging chamber.
| | |
| tum_y | The y-position of the tumor, in centimeters, relative to the center of the imaging chamber.
| | | 
| tum_z | The z-position of the tumor, in centimeters, relative to the top of the imaging chamber (where the chest wall would be).
| | |
| birads | The BI-RADS density class of the phantom. |
| | |
| adi_ref_id | The unique ID of the adipose-only reference scan for the experiment.
| | |
| empty_ref_id | The unique ID of the empty-chamber reference scan for the experiment.
| | |
| date_obtained | The date the scan was performed.|
| | |
| n_session | The number of the session in which the scan was performed. |
| | |
| ant_rad | The radial distance from the center of the imaging chamber of the SMA connection point on the antenna, measured in meters.
| | |
| ant_height | The height of the antenna, with respect to the top of the imaging chamber (where the chest wall would be), in centimeters. |
| | |
| fib_ang | The polar angle of rotation of the fibroglandular shell, in degrees. |
| | |
| phant_x | The x-position of the center of the adipose shell, with respect to the center of the imaging chamber, in centimeters. |
| | |
| phant-y | The y-position of the center of the adipose shell, with respect to the center of the imaging chamber, in centimeters. |
| | | 
| fib_ref_id | The unique ID of a reference scan containing both adipose and fibroglandular tissue components. |
| | |
| fib_x | The x-position of the center of the fibroglandular shell, with respect to the center of the **adipose shell**, in centimeters.|
| | |
| fib_y | The y-position of the center of the fibroglandular shell, with respect to the center of the **adipose shell**, in centimeters.|
